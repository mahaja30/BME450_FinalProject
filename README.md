## Project decription

Max Â½ page. Include some information on:

- dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
- This dataset has images of brain tumors separated as glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumors
- With this data, the goal will be to train a neural network to distinguish between a brain with or without a tumor
- Data was collected from a combination of three datasets: figshare, SARTAJ dataset, and Br35H
- Proper pre-processing, including resizing images to a consistent size, is recommended to enhance model accuracy
